The man in black fled across the desert, and the
gunslinger followed.
  The desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge,
standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in
all directions.  It was white and blinding and waterless
and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze
of the mountains which sketched themselves on the
horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet
dreams, nightmares, death.  An occasional tombstone
sign pointed the way, for once the drifted track that
cut its way through the thick crust of alkali had been
a highway.  Coaches and buckas had followed it.  The 
world had moved on since then.  The world had
emptied.
